# Hangman
a JavaFX word game

Ideally, when I have an idea for a project, the //challenge//, //will-this-work-?// are part of the allure that drive me to implement them.

But Hangman was not any of it. It is a simple project. The only annoying bit of peculiarity for this project was XML.

This is a //fill the missing letters in a word// game made for a friend. It occured to me that Hangman could be a good way to accelerate their vocabulary learning.

For persistence, this project uses my own LLFIOS, disk-based serialising CRUD, utility under the hood.
